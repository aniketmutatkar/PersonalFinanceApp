## üöÄ Usage

### Adding Transaction Data

1. Place your bank CSV exports in the `raw` directory:
   - Chase exports should contain "chase" in the filename
   - Citi exports should contain "citi" in the filename
   - Wells Fargo exports should contain "wells" or "fargo" in the filename

2. Run the main script to process transactions:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Launching the Dashboard

To view your financial data in the interactive dashboard:

```
streamlit run visualizations.py
```

This will open a web browser with the visualization dashboard.

### Importing Historical Data

To import historical data from an Excel file:

```
python run_historical_import.py
```

### Viewing Monthly Summary

For a text-based summary of monthly data:

```
python view_monthly_summary.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system is configured through `config.yaml`, which contains:

- Category definitions and keywords for automatic categorization
- Category mapping for standardizing imported categories
- Monthly budget values for each category

Example configuration:

```yaml
categories:
  Payment:
    - autopay
    - epay
    - online payment
  Rent: 
    - clickpay
    - rent
  # ... more categories

- For transactions categorized as "Misc", the system may prompt for manual categorization.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check your CSV file formats match the expected bank formats
- Ensure the `raw` and `transformed` directories exist
- Check the database file permissions

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
